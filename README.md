# Moving Test Dir

Really simple script to rename test directory for labs.

It renames the directory from `test` to `future_tests`.

To use:
- Clone down the repo
- Set the `path_to_labs_dir` method to return the path on your local machine to a directory where you want labs cloned down to
- Update the `labs` variable at the bottom to be a list of labs that you'd like to make the change to
- Run the script with `./moving-test-file.rb`
